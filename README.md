# 🚁 Small Computer Graphics Helicopter Scene 🚁

This is a simple but fun computer graphics application where you can fly a helicopter around a little scene I created. Think of it as your own mini aviation playground, complete with trees, rocks, and even a duck swimming in a pond (yes, a duck 🦆).

I’m using C and OpenGL to bring this project to life, as well as hierarchical modeling, lighting, and animations. If you’re into exploring scenes or just want to see a helicopter gracefully take off and land, this might be for you!

## 🚀 What you can do 🚀

- Fly a helicopter: Take off, land, and zip around the scene. You can even rotate it like a pro pilot!
- Enjoy the environment: Explore a cozy little world with trees, a pond, a lamppost, and a duck doing its infinity dance.
- Feel the spotlight: There’s an animated spotlight attached to the helicopter to brighten up your flights at night (or just show off).

## 🎮 Controls 🎮
l                 : Changes the scene between a wireframe and filled scene
up/down arrows    : Increase or decrease the height of your helicopter
left/right arrows : Turn left or right
w/s               : Move forward and backward
a/d               : Strafe left or right

## 📩 How to play? 📩

#### All you need to do is download the files as a zip folder from the code button above. Extract those and open the project in Visual Studio
#### Once the project is opened, press the run button at the top and you are good to go!
